# Indicators of Heavy Traffic on I-94 ðŸŒ±

## Overview âœ¨
The goal of this project is to analyze traffic data from the I-94 Interstate highway and identify key indicators of heavy traffic. These indicators include factors such as time of day, day of the week, weather conditions, and seasonal changes. By analyzing this data, we aim to gain insights into patterns and trends that contribute to traffic congestion.
